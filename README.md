# OperatingSystems-IT154
Machine problems I submitted for my operating systems class. 

Funny story, I was using Linux during the first exercise didn't realize Windows and Linux compiles codes differently. I got the lowest possible mark on the first exercise, then shifted to Windows for a while. Luckily I passed the class, but it gave me hard time. 
Barely passed this class.
